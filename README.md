# Object Constraint Language (OCL)

This documentation is intended for  **modelers** who use the object OCL 
languages.
A detailed documentation for **language engineers** using or extending the 
OCL language is 
located **[here](src/main/grammars/de/monticore/ocl/OCL.md)**.
We recommend that language engineers read this documentation before reading 
the detailed documentation.

# An Example Model

``` 
ocl Bookshop {
  context Shop s inv CustomerPaysBeforeNewOrder:      // invariant
    forall Customer c in s.customers:                 // quantifiers available
      c.allowedToOrder implies !exists Invoice i in s.invoices:
        i.buyer == c && i.moneyPayed < i.invoiceAmount ;

  // Method specification for selling a book
  context Invoice Stock.sellBook(String iban, int discountPercent, Customer c)
    let availableBooks =                              // set comprehension
          { book | Book book in booksInStock, book.iban == iban }
    pre:  !availableBooks.isEmpty &&                  // precondition
          c.allowedToOrder;
    post: let discount = (100 - discountPercent)/100; // postcondition, let
              b = result.soldBook                     // result variable
    in
        !(b isin booksInStock) &&
        booksInStock.size@pre == booksInStock.size + 1 &&  // @pre
        result.invoiceAmount == b.price * discount;           
}
```

Further expression examples (including MontiCore's [CommonExpressions][common-expr]):
```
a + 3*4;                       // number expressions
a >= b; a < 3; a == "myName";  // equalities
b implies (c && a) || d;       // boolean expressions
forall a in S: foo(a) > 3;     // quantifiers
exists a in S: foo(a) > 3;
a ?== b; c ?<= d               // elvis operators (dealing with optionals)
S.first; S.size; S.addAll(T);  // 30 operators for Lists
a in S; S.add(a);              // + more for Sets 
max(S) > 3;                    // + more for numbers
```

The textual OCL representation mostly relies on the definition in [[Rum16, 
Rum17]][mbse-books]. 
OCL is used to check the correctness of other models.
Here, the `Book` and `Customer` types are, for example, defined by a 
class diagram:

```
classdiagram Bookshop {
  class Book {
    String name;
    String iban;
    double cost;
    double price;
  }

  class Shop;
  association [1] Shop -> (invoices) Invoice [*];
  association [1] Shop -> (customers) Customer [*];

  class Stock {
    void addBook(Book b);
    Invoice sellBook(Book bookToSell, int discountPercent, Customer buyer);
  }
  association [1] Stock -> (booksInStock) Book [*];

  class Customer {
    String name;
    String phoneNumber;
    int customerNumber;
    boolean allowedToOrder;
    void payInvoice(double moneyWired, Invoice invoice);
  }

  class Invoice {
    int invoiceNumber;
    double invoiceAmount;
    double moneyPayed;
  }
  association [1] Invoice <-> (buyer) Customer [1];
  association [1] Invoice <-> (soldBook) Book [1];
}
```




# Command Line Interface (CLI)

This section describes the CLI tool of the OCL language. 
The CLI tool provides typical functionality used when
processing models. To this effect, it provides funcionality
for 
* parsing, 
* coco-checking, 
* pretty-printing, 
* creating symbol tables, 
* storing symbols in symbol files, and  
* loading symbols from symbol files.  

The requirements for building and using the OCL CLI tool are that (at least) 
JDK 8 (JDK 11 and JDK 14 are also officially supported by us), Git, and Gradle 
are installed and available for use in Bash. 
If you're using Docker, you can also use the CLI Docker container without 
installing Java, Git, or Gradle. 

The following subsection describes how to download the CLI tool.
Then, this document describes how to build the CLI tool from the source files.
Afterwards, this document contains a tutorial for using the CLI tool.  

## Downloading the Latest Version of the CLI Tool as JAR
A ready to use version of the CLI tool can be downloaded in the form of an 
executable JAR file.
You can use [**this download link**][cli] 
for downloading the CLI tool. 

Alternatively, you can download the CLI tool using `wget`.
The following command downloads the latest version of the CLI tool and saves it 
under the name `OCLCLI.jar` in your working directory:
```
wget "monticore.de/download/OCLCLI.jar" -O OCLCLI.jar
``` 

## Downloading the Latest Version of the CLI Tool Using Docker

The latest version of the CLI's Docker image can be obtained using 
```
docker pull monticore/ocl
```

In case you're using Docker, replace `java -jar OCLCLI.jar` in the following 
by (for Windows PowerShell, Mac Terminal, or Linux Bash)
```
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/input -w /input monticore/ocl
```
or (for Windows Command Line)
```
docker run --rm -v %CD%:/input -w /input monticore/ocl
```

For example, this command from Step 2 of this tutorial
```
java -jar OCLCLI.jar -i Example.ocl -pp
```
becomes
```
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/input -w /input monticore/ocl -i Example.ocl -pp
```
when using Docker.


## Building the CLI Tool from the Sources
 
It is possible to build an executable JAR of the CLI tool from the source files 
located in GitHub.
The following describes the process for building the CLI tool from the source 
files using Bash.
For building an executable Jar of the CLI with Bash from the source files 
available in GitHub, execute the following commands.

First, clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/MontiCore/ocl.git
```

Change the directory to the root directory of the cloned sources:
```
cd OCL
```

Then build the project by running (Info: you need to have Gradle 
installed for this):
```
gradle build
```
Congratulations! You can now find the executable JAR file `OCLCLI.jar` in
 the directory `target/libs` (accessible via `cd target/libs`).

## Tutorial: Getting Started Using the OCL CLI Tool
The previous sections describe how to obtain an executable JAR file
(OCL CLI tool). This section provides a tutorial for
using the OCL CLI tool. The following examples assume
that you locally named the CLI tool `OCLCLI`.
If you build the CLI tool from the sources or used the `wget`
command above, then you are fine. If you manually downloaded 
the CLI tool, then you should consider renaming the downloaded JAR.   

### First Steps
Executing the Jar file without any options prints usage information of the CLI 
tool to the console:
```
$ java -jar OCLCLI.jar
usage: OCLCLI
 -c,--coco <arg>               Checks the CoCos for the input. Optional
                               arguments are:
                               -c intra to check only the intra-model CoCos,
                               -c inter checks also inter-model CoCos,
                               -c type (default) checks all CoCos.
 -cd4c,--cd4code               Load symbol kinds from CD4C. Shortcut for loading
                               CDTypeSymbol as TypeSymbol,
                               CDMethodSignatureSymbol as FunctionSymbol, and
                               FieldSymbol as VariableSymbol. Furthermore,
                               warnings about not deserializing
                               CDAssociationSymbol and CDRoleSymbol will be
                               ignored.
 -d,--dev                      Specifies whether developer level logging should
                               be used (default is false)
 -fs,--functionSymbol <fqns>   Takes the fully qualified name of one or more
                               symbol kind(s) that should be treated as
                               FunctionSymbol when deserializing symbol files.
                               Multiple symbol kinds should be separated by
                               spaces.
 -h,--help                     Prints this help dialog
 -i,--input <files>            Processes the list of OCL input artifacts.
                               Argument list is space separated. CoCos are not
                               checked automatically (see -c).
 -is,--ignoreSymKind <fqns>    Takes the fully qualified name of one or more
                               symbol kind(s) for which no warnings about not
                               being able to deserialize them shall be printed.
                               Allows cleaner CLI outputs. Multiple symbol kinds
                               should be separated by spaces.
 -p,--path <directory>         Sets the artifact path for imported symbols.
                               Directory will be searched recursively for files
                               with the ending ".*sym" (for example ".cdsym" or
                               ".sym"). Defaults to the current folder.
 -pp,--prettyprint <files>     Prints the OCL model to stdout or the specified
                               file(s) (optional). Multiple files should be
                               separated by spaces and will be used in the same
                               order in which the input files (-i option) are
                               provided.
 -s,--symboltable <files>      Stores the symbol tables of the input OCL
                               artifacts in the specified files. For each input
                               OCL artifact (-i option) please provide one
                               output symbol file (using same order in which the
                               input artifacts are provided) to store its
                               symbols in. For example, -i x.ocl y.ocl -s
                               a.oclsym b.oclsym will store the symbols of x.ocl
                               to a.oclsym and the symbols of y.ocl to b.oclsym.
                               Arguments are separated by spaces. If no
                               arguments are given, output is stored to
                               'target/symbols/{packageName}/{artifactName}.ocls
                               ym'.
 -ts,--typeSymbol <fqns>       Takes the fully qualified name of one or more
                               symbol kind(s) that should be treated as
                               TypeSymbol when deserializing symbol files.
                               Multiple symbol kinds should be separated by
                               spaces.
 -vs,--variableSymbol <fqns>   Takes the fully qualified name of one or more
                               symbol kind(s) that should be treated as
                               VariableSymbol when deserializing symbol files.
                               Multiple symbol kinds should be separated by
                               spaces.
```
To work properly, the CLI tool needs the mandatory argument `-i,--input <file>`, 
which takes the file paths of at least one input file containing SD models.
If no other arguments are specified, the CLI tool solely parses the model(s).

For trying this out, copy the `OCLCLI.jar` into a directory of your 
choice. 
Afterwards, create  containing the following simple OCL :
```
ocl Example {
}
```

Save the text file as `Example.ocl` in the directory where `OCLCLI.jar` is 
located. 

Now execute the following command:
```
java -jar OCLCLI.jar -i Example.ocl
```

You may notice that the CLI tool prints no output to the console.
This means that the tool has parsed the file `Example.ocl` successfully.

### Step 2: Pretty-Printing
The CLI tool provides a pretty-printer for the OCL language.
A pretty-printer can be used, e.g., to fix the formatting of files containing 
OCL.
To execute the pretty-printer, the `-pp,--prettyprint` option can be used.
Using the option without any arguments pretty-prints the models contained in the
input files to the console.

Execute the following command for trying this out:
```
java -jar OCLCLI.jar -i Example.ocl -pp
```
The command prints the pretty-printed model contained in the input file to the 
console:
```
ocl Example {
}
```

It is possible to pretty-print the models contained in the input files to output
files.
For this task, it is possible to provide the names of output files as arguments 
to the `-pp,--prettyprint` option.
If arguments for output files are provided, then the number of output files must
be equal to the number of input files.
The i-th input file is pretty-printed into the i-th output file.

Execute the following command for trying this out:
```
java -jar OCLCLI.jar -i Example.ocl -pp Output.ocl
```
The command prints the pretty-printed model contained in the input file into the 
file `Output.ocl`.

### Step 3: Checking Context Conditions
For checking context conditions, the `-c,--coco <arg>` option can be used. 
Using this option without any arguments checks whether the model satisfies all 
context conditions. 

If you are only interested in checking whether a model only satisfies a subset 
of the context conditions or want to explicate that all context conditions 
should be checked, you can do this by additionally providing one of the three
arguments `intra`, `inter`, and `type`.
* Using the argument `intra` only executes context conditions concerning 
  violations of intra-model context conditions.
  These context conditions, for example, check naming conventions. 
* Using the argument `inter` executes all intra-model context conditions and 
  additionally checks whether type names in constructor signatures are defined.
* Using the argument `type` executes all context coniditions. 
  These context conditions include checking whether used types and methods 
  exist. 
  The behavior when using the argument `type` is the equal to the default 
  behavior when using no arguments. 

Execute the following command for trying out a simple example:
```
java -jar OCLCLI.jar -i Example.ocl -c -cd4c
```
You may notice that the CLI prints nothing to the console when executing this 
command.
This means that the model satisfies all context condtions. 

Let us now consider a more complex example.
Recall the OCL `Bookshop` from the `An Example Model` section above.
For continuing, copy the textual representation of the OCL `Bookshop` and 
save it in a file `Bookshop.ocl` in the directory where the file `OCLCLI.jar` 
is located. 
For this you will need a symbol file containing the symbols of a class diagram
corresponding to the `Bookshop.ocl`. 
This will be explained in more detail in the following section. 
For now, just add `-p src/test/resources/docs/Bookshop/ -cd4c` to the command to use tell 
the CLI where to find the symbol file prepared for this example and how to 
process it.

You can check the different kinds of context conditions, using the 
`-c,--coco <arg>` option:
```
java -jar OCLCLI.jar -i Bookshop.ocl -p src/test/resources/docs/Bookshop/ -cd4c -c intra
```
```
java -jar OCLCLI.jar -i Bookshop.ocl -p src/test/resources/docs/Bookshop/ -cd4c -c inter
```
```
java -jar OCLCLI.jar -i Bookshop.ocl -p src/test/resources/docs/Bookshop/ -cd4c -c type
```
None of these commands should produce output. 

To see an error lets add a mistake to the model. 
Replace this line in `Bookshop.ocl`
```
{ book | Book book in booksInStock, book.iban == iban }
```
by 
```
{ book2 | Book book in booksInStock, book.iban == iban }
```
As `book2` is undefined, the CLI should now print an Error message when 
checking the cocos:

```
$ java -jar OCLCLI.jar  -i Bookshop.ocl -p src/test/resources/docs/Bookshop/ -cd4c -c
[INFO]  DeriveSymTypeOfExpression package suspected
[ERROR] 0xA0309 Bookshop.ocl:<13,12> Could not calculate type of expression "book2" on the left side of SetComprehension
```

Please remember to undo the "mistake". 

### Step 4: Using the Symbol Path to Resolve Symbols

In this section we make use of the symbol path and provide the CLI tool with
a symbol file (stored symbol table) of another model, which contains the 
necessary type information.

Create a new directory `mytypes` in the directory where the CLI tool 
`OCLCLI.jar` is located.
For example, the `Bookshop.ocl` example from the first section required a 
class diagram that specified its datatypes. 
You can find this class diagram file under 
[src/test/resources/docs/Bookshop/Bookshop.cd](src/test/resources/docs/Bookshop/Bookshop.cd). 

To use it in OCL, you first need to convert it info a symbol file.
The symbol file `Bookshop.sym` of the class diagram provides all necessary type 
information to use its types in OCL. 
If you don't want to get involved with the CDCLI at this point, you can also find the 
ready-to-use file under 
[src/test/resources/docs/Bookshop/Bookshop.sym](src/test/resources/docs/Bookshop/Bookshop.sym).
Just copy it into your `mytypes` folder.
Otherwise, to convert the class diagram into a symbol file you need to use the 
`CDCLI.jar` from the 
[CD4Analysis Project][cd4c] and convert the class diagram file using the following command:
```
java -jar CDCLI.jar -d false --fieldfromrole navigable -i src/test/resources/docs/Bookshop/Bookshop.cd -s mytypes/Bookshop.sym
```

The contents of the symbol file are of minor importance for you as a language 
user. 
In case you are curious and had a look into the symbol file: 
The symbol file contains a JSON representation of the symbols defined in a 
model.
In this case, the symbol file contains information about defined types. 
Usually, the CLI tools of MontiCore languages automatically generate the 
contents of these files and you, as a language user, must not be concerned with 
their contents. 
  
The path containing the directory structure that contains the symbol file is 
called the "Symbol Path".
If we provide the symbol path to the tool, it will search for symbols in symbol 
files, which are stored in directories contained in the symbol path.
So, if we want the tool to find our symbol file, we have to provide the model 
path to the tool via the `--path <directory>` option.
You can try that out using the `mytypes` folder you just created:
```
java -jar OCLCLI.jar -i Bookshop.ocl --path <SYMBOLPATH> -c type -cd4c
```
where `<SYMBOLPATH>` is the path where you stored the downloaded symbol file.
In our example, in case you stored the model in the directory `mytypes`,
execute the following command:
```
java -jar OCLCLI.jar -i Bookshop.ocl --path mytypes -c type -cd4c
```

Notice that this command also uses the `-cd4c` flag. 
To interpret the symbolfiles provided to the OCL CLI, the OCL CLI 
needs to understand how to interpret the symbols stored by the 
CDCLI.
The  `-cd4c` flag is a shorthand for doing this for CD4Code.
You can also do it manually by using the `--typeSymbol`, 
`--functionSymbol`, and `--variableSymbol` flags followed by 
the symbol kinds that should be interpreted as `TypeSymbol`, 
`FunctionSymbol` and `VariableSymbol`:
```
java -jar OCLCLI.jar -i Bookshop.ocl --path mytypes -c type --typeSymbol <TYPE_SYMBOL_KINDS> --variableSymbol <VAR_SYMBOL_KINDS> --functionSymbol <FUNC_SYMBOL_KINDS>
```
where `<TYPE_SYMBOL_KINDS>`, `<VAR_SYMBOL_KINDS>`, and 
`<FUNC_SYMBOL_KINDS>` are the fully qualified names of the symbols. 
In case you want to provide multiple symbol types, just add them 
separated by a space.
In our example, declaring the symbols from CD4Analysis 
would look like this:
```
java -jar OCLCLI.jar -i Bookshop.ocl --path mytypes -c type --typeSymbol de.monticore.cdbasis._symboltable.CDTypeSymbol --variableSymbol de.monticore.symbols.oosymbols._symboltable.FieldSymbol --functionSymbol de.monticore.cd4codebasis._symboltable.CDMethodSignatureSymbol
```

Notice that the CLI now produces a lot of warnings on symbols 
that could not be interpreted. 
Not every symbol of a differnt language might be interesting in 
OCL.
To suppress these unintended warnings, you can tell the OCL CLI
for which symbol kinds you do not want to receive them using the 
`--ignoreSymKind <SYM_KINDS_TO_IGNORE>` option. 
In our example, this would look like this:
```
java -jar OCLCLI.jar -i Bookshop.ocl --path mytypes -c type --typeSymbol de.monticore.cdbasis._symboltable.CDTypeSymbol --variableSymbol de.monticore.symbols.oosymbols._symboltable.FieldSymbol --functionSymbol de.monticore.cd4codebasis._symboltable.CDMethodSignatureSymbol --ignoreSymKind de.monticore.cdassociation._symboltable.CDAssociationSymbol de.monticore.cdassociation._symboltable.CDRoleSymbol
```

For everyday use, this is a little complicated. 
So remember that the `-cd4c` flag can reduce this to only
```
java -jar OCLCLI.jar -i Bookshop.ocl --path mytypes -c type -cd4c
```

### Step 5: Storing Symbols
The previous section describes how to load symbols from an existing symbol file.
Now, we will use the CLI tool to store a symbol file for our `Bookshop.ocl` model.
The stored symbol file will contain information about the objects defined in the 
OCL file.
It can be imported by other models for using the symbols introduced by these 
object definitions, similar to how we changed the file `Bookshop.ocl` for 
importing the symbols contained in the symbol file `Bookshop.sym`.

Using the `-s,-symboltable <file>` option builds the symbol tables of the 
input models and stores them in the file paths given as arguments.
Either no file paths must be provided or exactly one file path has to be 
provided for each input model.
The symbol file for the i-th input model is stored in the file defined by the 
i-th file path. 
If you do not provide any file paths, the CLI tool stores the symbol table of 
each input model in the symbol file 
`target/symbols/{packageName}/{fileName}.oclsym` where `packageName` is the name 
of the package as specified in the file containing the model and `fileName` is 
the name of the file containing the model. 
The file is stored relative to the working directory, i.e., the directory in 
which you execute the command for storing the symbol files.
Furthermore, please notice that in order to store the symbols properly, the 
model has to be well-formed in all regards, and therefore all context conditions 
are checked beforehand.

For storing the symbol file of `Bookshop.ocl`, execute the following command 
(the implicit context condition checks require using the symbol path option):
```
java -jar OCLCLI.jar -i Bookshop.ocl --path mytypes -cd4c -s
```
The CLI tool produces the file `target/symbols/docs/Bookshop.oclsym`, which 
can now be imported by other models, e.g., by models that need to use some 
of the objects defined in the OCL file `Bookshop`.

For storing the symbol file of `Bookshop.ocl` in the file 
`syms/Bookshop.oclsym`, for example, execute the following command
(again, the implicit context condition checks require using the symbol path 
option):
```
java -jar OCLCLI.jar -i Bookshop.ocl -path mytypes -cd4c -s syms/Bookshop.oclsym
```

Congratulations, you have just finished the tutorial about saving SD symbol 
files!
